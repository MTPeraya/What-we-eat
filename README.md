## Installation Guide

### 1\. Clone the Repository

First, you need to download the project files to your local machine. You can do this using the `git clone` command in your terminal or command prompt.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MTPeraya/What-we-eat.git
```

This command will create a new folder named `What-we-eat` containing all the project files.


### 2\. Inspect the Project Files

Navigate into the newly created directory:

```bash
cd What-we-eat
```

-----

### 3\. Run the Project

There are two ways to run this project: you can run both the frontend and backend together using Docker, or you can run each service individually.

### Easiest Method: Run Everything with Docker

If you have Docker installed, the simplest way to get both the frontend and backend running is with a single command from the project's root directory.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will build and start both services for you.

### Alternative Method: Run Services Individually

If you don't have Docker or prefer to run the services separately, you can do so using `npm`. You will need to open two separate terminal windows.

1.  **In your first terminal**, navigate to the frontend folder and start the development server:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **In your second terminal**, navigate to the backend folder and start the server:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```

-----

If you follow these steps, you should be able to get the "What-we-eat" project running. The key is to first identify the type of project by looking for the files mentioned above. Good luck! üëç
